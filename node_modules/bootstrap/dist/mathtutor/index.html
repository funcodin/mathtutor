              <p>Hillary Clinton has had enough of Bernie Sanders' attacks on her ties to big money in politics and Wall Street.
"If you've got something to say, say it," Clinton said, saying his "innuendo" and "insinuation" was not worthy of him. "It's time to end this very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out."
Clinton said she has never shifted a vote or position because of campaign contributions.
"Enough is enough."
Sanders shot back with a long list of interests -- from Wall Street to drug and oil companies -- who lobby for their interests.
"There is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system."</p>
